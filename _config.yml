# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: "Hi! I'm <strong>Dr. Randal S. Olson</strong>. I'm a full stack data scientist and AI researcher based in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area.<br /><br />

I specialize in artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, and data visualization, and occasionally write about my latest work on my <a href='blog/'>personal blog</a>, where I've become known for computing optimal road trips around the world and solving <em>Whereâ€™s Waldo?</em>, among many other creative applications of machine learning. My work has been featured all over the world and in the news, including the <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/14/upshot/stuff-we-liked.html'>New York Times</a>, <a href='https://www.wired.com/2015/02/created-perfect-wheres-waldo-strategy-machine-learning/'>Wired</a>, <a href='https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-12-months-of-record-setting-temperatures-looks-like-across-the-u-s/'>FiveThirtyEight</a>, <a href='https://www.theonion.com/study-settling-for-adequate-partner-better-than-waitin-1819562531'>The Onion</a>, and much more.<br /><br />

I work tirelessly to promote open and reproducible science, leading by example and openly publishing my work on <a href='https://github.com/rhiever/Data-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning-Projects'>GitHub</a> and <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LU96GEAAAAAJ&hl=en'>open access journals</a> whenever I can. I'm also passionate about training the next generation of data scientists to be more efficient, effective, and collaborative in their work, and do so by <a href='https://nbviewer.org/github/rhiever/Data-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/example-data-science-notebook/Example%20Machine%20Learning%20Notebook.ipynb'>writing online tutorials</a>, <a href='http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920046592.do'>recording video tutorials</a>, <a href='https://software-carpentry.org/'>teaching hands-on workshops</a>, and <a href='mentoring/'>mentoring local students</a> in my research specialties.<br /><br />
