<p>I attended a Software Carpentry workshop hosted by <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/" target="_blank">Titus Brown</a> and <a href="http://third-bit.com/" target="_blank">Greg Wilson</a> this week and was introduced to, among many other things, a piece of software that I've been looking for ever since I started my graduate program: <a href="http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/htmlnotebook.html" target="_blank">IPython Notebook</a>. It can easily be installed with the majority of the other packages you'll need in the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/" target="_blank">Anaconda Python distribution</a>.</p>
<p>I do the majority of my post-experiment data analysis in Python nowadays, since it's one of the few sanely-designed scripting languages out there with all the functionality I need. What I've been missing is a seamless user interface where I can both take notes about my research <em>and</em> perform my data analysis in the same location. IPython Notebook finally provides that.</p>
<p>Ever since I announced my conversion from RTF files to IPython Notebook as my primary means of taking research notes, I've received a lot of flack about how Python doesn't support advanced statistical tests, such as bootstrapping confidence intervals, Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon RankSum tests, and ANOVA tests. After a day of searching with my lab mates, I finally turned up all the libraries I need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bootstrapped confidence intervals: <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scikits.bootstrap" target="_blank">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scikits.bootstrap</a></li>
<li>MWW RankSum test: <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ranksums.html" target="_blank">http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ranksums.html</a></li>
<li>ANOVA: <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.f_oneway.html" target="_blank">http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.f_oneway.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you can't find a Python library for a statistical test you need, post here and we'll try to find it. The IPython notebook has plenty of uses beyond a research notebook, too. For example, Titus Brown recently posted the IPython notebook that he used to generate all of the graphs in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170303022909/http://ged.msu.edu:80/papers/2012-diginorm/" target="_blank">one of his recent papers</a>. Imagine the implications for science if scientists actually start showing the code they used to generate their graphs! (No more hiding that outlier point on the side of the graph...)</p>
<p>I'll be putting up some tutorials and examples of how to use IPython Notebook for exploratory statistical data analysis soon, so stay posted!</p>
