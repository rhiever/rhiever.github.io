<p><strong>Update (Nov. 2014):</strong> IPython Notebook installation has advanced considerably since I originally published this post. Check out the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">Anaconda Python Distribution</a> for an easy one-click installer for all your Python library needs.</p>
<hr />
<p>Today I ran a small (~20 person) 1-hour workshop at Michigan State University focusing on installing IPython Notebook and using it as a research notebook. Since I knew it's quite a pain to install IPython Notebook for the first time, I put together a set of installation instructions for both <a href="https://github.com/rhiever/ipython-notebook-workshop#windows">Windows</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rhiever/ipython-notebook-workshop#mac-and-linux">Mac/Linux</a> and asked the attendees to attempt to install IPython Notebook ahead of time. On top of that, I held a 30-minute session before the workshop dedicated solely to installing IPython Notebook (which admittedly, helped a little bit).</p>
<p>By the end of it, I was able to get through the IPython Notebook demo, and many people seemed excited about using it for their research. Before everyone left, I had the attendees fill out a post-workshop survey to get their opinion on the workshop. In the post-workshop survey, I found some interesting trends in the responses:</p>
<ul>
<li>All but one attendee indicated that they understood how to use IPython Notebook and found its interface intuitive</li>
<li>Half of the workshop attendees indicated that they planned to start using IPython Notebook for their research</li>
<li>Those that indicated that they don't plan to use IPython Notebook for their research cited installation issues as the primary or secondary reason for not doing so</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the third trend is the most telling: <strong>one of the biggest barriers to the adoption of IPython Notebook is installation issues</strong>. <a href="https://twitter.com/jseabold/status/294559714346401792">This isn't an uncommon observation</a>, either. In my case, despite all of my precautions, the workshop was still plagued by installation issues. At least 1/4 of the workshop attendees had these issues during the workshop, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Missing libraries being required for the newer version of IPython Notebook that don't come with the installation package (not even <a href="http://www.enthought.com/products/epd_free.php">EPD</a>) by default</li>
<li>IPython Notebook not running in Chrome, only Firefox</li>
<li>pandas compatibility issues with the newer version IPython Notebook</li>
<li>Newer ipynb files not being backwards-compatible with older IPython Notebook versions</li>
</ul>
<p>This highlights <del datetime="2013-06-02T16:49:02+00:00">two key</del> some key issues the IPython community needs to work on before IPython can reach a broader audience: <del datetime="2013-06-02T16:49:02+00:00">(1) we cannot rely on EPD to maintain a free, update-to-date Python package installer and (2)</del> we need to sort out the IPython installation process and distill it to a single, double-click install file.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Fernando Perez offered some <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2013/01/24/ipython-notebook-workshop-report-still-plagued-by-installation-issues/#comment-88">easy installation instructions</a> that seem to have solved the installation issues. I will report on how these work out in an upcoming workshop soon!</p>
