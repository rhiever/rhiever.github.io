<p>I got bored today and threw together some Python code to scrape word frequencies from Reddit and make word clouds. Everyone on Reddit seemed to love them, so <a href="https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis" target="_blank">I put them up on github</a> so everyone could start making their own word clouds. All that's really left to do is connect these scripts to a word cloud generating library so we don't even have to copy & paste text into <a href="http://www.wordle.net/" target="_blank">Wordle</a> any more. If you're up to the task, please email me and fork away on github.</p>
<p>Making word clouds for subreddits is a surprisingly effective way to get a gist for what a subreddit is really talking about. Take <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/" target="_blank">/r/evolution</a>, for example. They're serious business about evolution.</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2013/03/evolution.png" target="_blank"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2013/03/evolution.png" alt="evolution" width="90%" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-664" /></a></p>
<p>Others were more amusing. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/" target="_blank">/r/trees</a>, for example, seems to be preoccupied with cursing about things.</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2013/03/trees.png" target="_blank"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2013/03/trees.png" alt="trees" width="90%" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-665" /></a></p>
<p>whereas <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/" target="_blank">/r/aww</a> can be concisely described by "upvote cats, fuck humans."</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2013/03/aww.png" target="_blank"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2013/03/aww.png" alt="aww" width="90%" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-666" /></a></p>
<p>Even the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/space/" target="_blank">/r/space</a> nerds seem to get riled up when discussing NASA, terraforming, and meteorites.</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2013/03/space.png" target="_blank"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2013/03/space.png" alt="space" width="90%" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-674" /></a></p>
<p>Come join in on the fun and make some word clouds for your favorite subreddit: <a href="https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis" target="_blank">https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis</a></p>
