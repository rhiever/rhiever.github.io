<p>Yesterday, I got bored and hastily hacked together a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2013/03/01/fun-with-the-python-reddit-api-wrapper-and-word-clouds/" title="Fun with the Python Reddit API Wrapper and word clouds" target="_blank">script to scrape word frequencies from Reddit and make word clouds out of them</a>. Of course, I included the <a href="https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis" target="_blank">source code on github</a> so everyone else could use the script if they wanted to. Overnight, some people I've never met before found my repo, decided they loved it, improved my script 1000x, <a href="https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis/pull/2" target="_blank">committed their changes to my github repo</a>, then <a href="https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/pull/192" target="_blank">started promoting my github repo</a> through venues I'd never even thought of.</p>
<p>Isn't that amazing?</p>
<p>Just because I openly posted my code on the internet, a group of people came together to refine my work and make it better for everyone. In the end, I learned some new coding tricks, the code is reaching a broader audience of people that I'd never imagined, and everyone ended up with a better final product.</p>
<p><strong>Wouldn't it be nice if science worked this way?</strong></p>
