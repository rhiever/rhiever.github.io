<p>Over the weekend, I discovered a web site where a group of dedicated film fanatics have been <a href="http://www.moviebodycounts.com/">systematically counting on-screen kills for various actors</a> for several years. I immediately set out to scrape all of the data from their web site and forums so I could visualize it and see what we could learn. I <a href="http://figshare.com/articles/On_screen_movie_kill_counts_for_hundreds_of_actors/889718">posted the data online</a> to save everyone else the chore of repeating the scrape.</p>
<p>Below is the second in a series of visualizations I created, showing the top 25 deadliest actors by on-screen kill counts. If you would like to feature any of these visualizations on your own web site, please <a href="http://www.randalolson.com/contact/" title="Contact">contact me</a> first.</p>

<h3>Some interesting facts</h3>
<hr />
<p><a href="http://www.moviebodycounts.com/Uma_Thurman.htm">Uma Thurman</a> ranks in as the deadliest woman with 77 on-screen kills.</p>
<hr />
<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger's highest single-film kill count comes from Commando (1985), where in the final island scene he racked up 74 kills: 2 throats slit, 51 people shot, 1 person stabbed, 2 people stabbed by circular blades, 5 people blown up by grenades, 5 people blown up by rocket launcher, 7 people blown up by planted explosives, and 1 unfortunate person impaled.</p>
<hr />
<p>The highest kill count by any one person in a film was attained by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0423663/">Tomisaburo Wakayama</a>, who scored a shocking 150 kills in Lone Wolf and Cub: White Heaven in Hell (1974).</p>
