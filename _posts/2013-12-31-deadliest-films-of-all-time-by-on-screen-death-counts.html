<p>Over the weekend, I discovered a web site where a group of dedicated film fanatics have been <a href="http://www.moviebodycounts.com/">systematically counting on-screen deaths in various films</a> for several years. I immediately set out to scrape all of the data from their web site and forums so I could visualize it and see what we could learn. I <a href="http://figshare.com/articles/On_screen_movie_kill_counts_for_hundreds_of_films/889719">posted the data online</a> to save everyone else the chore of repeating the scrape.</p>
<p>Below is the first in a series of visualizations I created, showing the top 25 deadliest films by on-screen death counts. If you would like to feature any of these visualizations on your own web site, please <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/#contact" title="Contact">contact me</a> first.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_2244" align="aligncenter" width="848"]<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2013/12/25-Deadliest-Films.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2013/12/25-Deadliest-Films.png" alt="25 deadliest films by on-screen death counts" width="848" height="636" class="size-full wp-image-2244" /></a> <strong>25 deadliest films by on-screen death counts</strong>[/caption]</p>
<p>I also created a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2013/12/100-Deadliest-Films.png">Top 100 list</a> if 25 just isn't enough.</p>
<h3>Some interesting facts</h3>
<hr />
<p>Despite being rated PG-13, Lord of the Rings: Return of the King has the most on-camera deaths in a movie in all time.</p>
<hr />
<p>Across all of the Lord of the Rings movies, Legolas in fact won the on-screen kill count contest with Gimli, with 57 on-screen kills vs. 25 on-screen kills for Gimli.</p>
<hr />
<p>Despite its claim to fame as being the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a0L3Z1A-RM">bloodiest film of all time</a>, Hot Shots Part Deux ranked in with only 114 on-screen kills.</p>
<hr />
<p>Orlando Bloom is in 4 of the top 8 deadliest films of all time.</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p>This visualization has made its way around the internet. Here's some common questions I heard asked about it.</p>
<blockquote><p>What about movies where a building/airplane/planet/death star exploded? That counts for hundreds/thousands/millions of on-screen deaths.</p></blockquote>
<p>The web site I took the data from only counts visible, on-screen deaths. Implied deaths, such as an entire planet exploding, are not counted.</p>
<blockquote><p>A movie I know of is missing that definitely has at least (large number) of deaths in it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The folks gathering the data have counted most of the movies with high kill counts. Although they have been at it for several years, this is by no means a comprehensive list. If you're willing to do a body count for the movie, awesome! Check their <a href="http://moviebodycounts.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=general&action=display&thread=6">kill counting guidelines</a> and <a href="http://moviebodycounts.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=general">post a report</a> on their forums.</p>
<blockquote><p>I don't believe the body count for one of the movies.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can go to the data source's <a href="http://www.moviebodycounts.com/movies.htm">Movie Index</a> and double-check the counts for yourself. They provide a scene-by-scene breakdown.</p>
<blockquote><p>If 600 people died in the movie 300, does that mean the Spartans had a 1:1 killing ratio?</p></blockquote>
<p>No. The movie did not show all 300 Spartans dying, and there were several implied deaths on the Persian's side.</p>
