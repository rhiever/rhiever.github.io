<p>Last weekend, I discovered a web site where a group of dedicated film fanatics have been <a href="http://www.moviebodycounts.com/">systematically counting on-screen deaths in various films</a> for several years. I immediately set out to scrape all of the data from their web site and forums so I could visualize it and see what we could learn. I <a href="http://figshare.com/articles/On_screen_movie_kill_counts_for_hundreds_of_films/889719">posted the data online</a> to save everyone else the chore of repeating the scrape.</p>
<p>Below is the fourth in a <a href="http://www.randalolson.com/2013/12/31/deadliest-films-of-all-time-by-on-screen-death-counts/">series of visualizations</a> I created, showing the top 25 most murderous directors ordered by the number of on-screen deaths in their films. If you would like to feature any of these visualizations on your own web site, please <a href="http://www.randalolson.com/contact/" title="Contact">contact me</a> first.</p>

<h3>Some interesting facts</h3>
<hr />
<p>The most murderous female director? <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0902290/">Katja von Garnier</a> with 256 on-screen deaths in films she's directed.</p>
<hr />
<p>Most of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001392/">Peter Jackson's</a> film deaths happen in just two films. 836 in LotR: Return of the King (2003) and 468 in LotR: The Two Towers (2002).</p>
<hr />
<p>This picture really helps Peter Jackson's case for being the most murderous director of all time:</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_2396" align="aligncenter" width="194"]<a href="http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/Peter_Jackson.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/01/Peter_Jackson.jpg" alt="Peter Jackson: Murderous" width="194" height="245" class="size-full wp-image-2396" /></a> Peter Jackson: Murderous[/caption]</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000247/">John Woo</a> seems to have stopped actively directing films in 2003, so even though Jackson and Woo are ranked closely, it looks like Jackson will easily maintain his lead -- especially with The Hobbit films coming out!</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000230/">Sylvester Stallone</a> ranked in <a href="http://www.randalolson.com/2013/12/31/deadliest-actors-of-all-time-by-on-screen-kills-in-movies/" title="Top 25 deadliest actors of all time by on-screen kills in movies">3rd on the deadliest actor list</a> and 15th on the most murderous directors list. Unsurprisingly for some, Stallone has truly built a career off of violence and death on film!</p>
