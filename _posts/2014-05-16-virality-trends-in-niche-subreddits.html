<p>For the past week, I've been <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2014/05/16/popular-subreddits-have-predictable-cycles-of-virality/#methodology">mapping out virality trends on various subreddits</a> to better understand how posts go viral on reddit. As a neat side effect, I discovered that several niche subreddits have their own interesting virality patterns. Below are a few that I thought were worth sharing.</p>
<h3>/r/asoiaf and /r/gameofthrones</h3>
<p>Every Sunday, a new episode of Game of Thrones airs on HBO. Without missing a beat, the two subreddits dedicated to Game of Thrones light up the day after the show as folks talk about the latest goings-on in the show. This happens pretty consistently for nearly every TV show on reddit.</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/asoiaf-hotness-heatmap.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/asoiaf-hotness-heatmap.png" alt="asoiaf-hotness-heatmap" width="1067" height="554" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4009" /></a></p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/gameofthrones-hotness-heatmap.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/gameofthrones-hotness-heatmap.png" alt="gameofthrones-hotness-heatmap" width="1067" height="657" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4010" /></a></p>
<p>Note that the /r/gameofthrones plot is missing about a week of data.</p>
<h3>/r/HIMYM and /r/thewalkingdead</h3>
<p>Just as TV show subreddits rise in popularity as a new TV show comes out, so too do they die out when the series is on hiatus. Since <em>How I Met Your Mother</em> and <em>The Walking Dead</em> ended their seasons in March, /r/HIMYM and /r/thewalkingdead have slowly faded into obscurity... until next season (for /r/thewalkingdead, anyway).</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/HIMYM-hotness-heatmap.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/HIMYM-hotness-heatmap.png" alt="HIMYM-hotness-heatmap" width="1067" height="544" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4013" /></a></p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/thewalkingdead-hotness-heatmap.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/thewalkingdead-hotness-heatmap.png" alt="thewalkingdead-hotness-heatmap" width="1067" height="554" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4014" /></a></p>
<h3>Talking about video games isn't so popular on the weekends</h3>
<p>In the niche video gaming news subreddits /r/Games & /r/gamernews, it looks like gamers sign off of reddit and go back to playing video games on the weekends.</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/gamernews-hotness-heatmap.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/gamernews-hotness-heatmap.png" alt="gamernews-hotness-heatmap" width="1067" height="544" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4017" /></a></p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/Games-hotness-heatmap.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/Games-hotness-heatmap.png" alt="Games-hotness-heatmap" width="1067" height="554" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4018" /></a></p>
