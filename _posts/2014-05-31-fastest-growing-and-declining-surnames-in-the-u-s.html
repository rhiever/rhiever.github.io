<p>Since my teens, I've been curious how many Olsons there are out there. I've seen some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bree_Olson">"celebrity" Olsons</a> and even made friends with a couple Olsons throughout my life, but I've always assumed that Olson is a fairly rare last name. To my glee, just yesterday I discovered that the U.S. Census Bureau releases lists of the most common surnames in the U.S. every 10 years. I was quick to look up my surname: 163,502 Olsons in 2000, up +19.5% from 1990. The Olsonian empire is growing!</p>
<p>If you want to look yours up, here's the raw data: <a href="http://www.census.gov/topics/population/genealogy/data/1990_census.html">1990</a> | <a href="http://www.census.gov/topics/population/genealogy/data/2000_surnames.html">2000</a></p>
<p>Of course, I couldn't stop there. Below, I plotted the fastest growing and declining surnames in the U.S. from 1990-2000. If you take note of the racial/ethnic background of the surnames, you'll see an eye-opening trend: Hispanic/Latino surnames are rapidly growing, whereas White/Black surnames are steadily declining in the U.S. (I grouped White/Black because most of the declining surnames were evenly split between White/Black.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/us-census-surnames.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/us-census-surnames.png" alt="us-census-surnames" width="911" height="693" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4432" /></a></p>
<p>For those who follow the news, this finding should be fairly unsurprising: Hispanics/Latinos have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140419184001/http://online.wsj.com:80/news/articles/SB10001424052748704604704576220603247344790">leading the U.S. in population growth</a> for quite some time now. So while Lopez is probably <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzX23qVqyJg">gonna be alright</a>, Jackson will soon have to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdxUFDoQe0">beat it</a> from the most common surname charts.</p>
<p>Just for fun, here's the growth trends for some celebrity surnames:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Roberts</strong>: 366,215 in 2000 (-3.8% from 1990)</li>
<li><strong>Ford</strong>: 178,397 (-12.5%)</li>
<li><strong>Carey</strong>: 54,924 (+16.2)</li>
<li><strong>Monroe</strong>: 53,475 (-2.3%)</li>
<li><strong>Hanks</strong>: 17,141 (+14.9%)</li>
<li><strong>Pitt</strong>: 8,666 (-12.9%)</li>
<li><strong>Eastwood</strong>: 5,113 (+2.8%)</li>
<li><strong>Bieber</strong>: 4,294 (-13.7%)</li>
<li><strong>Cruise</strong>: 3,058 (-38.5%)</li>
<li><strong>Johansson</strong>: 2,429 (-2.3%)</li>
</ul>
<p>The U.S. Census Bureau hasn't released the list for 2010 yet, but as soon as they do, I'll update this post.</p>
