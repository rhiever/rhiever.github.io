<p>Want to learn more about data visualization with Python?</p>
<p>Take a look at my <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920046592.do">Data Visualization Basics with Python video course</a> on O'Reilly.</p>
<hr />
<p>It's been well over a year since I wrote my last tutorial, so I figure I'm overdue. This time, I'm going to focus on how you can make beautiful data visualizations in Python with <a href="http://matplotlib.org">matplotlib</a>.</p>
<p>There are already tons of tutorials on how to make basic plots in matplotlib. There's even a huge <a href="http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html">example plot gallery</a> right on the matplotlib web site, so I'm not going to bother covering the basics here. However, one aspect that's missing in all of these tutorials and examples is how to make a <em>nice-looking</em> plot.</p>
<p>Below, I'm going to outline the basics of effective graphic design and show you how it's done in matplotlib. I'll note that these tips aren't limited to matplotlib; they apply just as much in R/ggplot2, matlab, Excel, and any other graphing tool you use.</p>
<h3>Less is more</h3>
<p>The most important tip to learn here is that <strong>when it comes to plotting, less is more</strong>. Novice graphical designers often make the mistake of thinking that <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/features/dssafeswimmingpool/dssafeswimmingpool_b626px.jpg">adding a cute semi-related picture to the background</a> of a data visualization will make it more visually appealing. (Yes, that graphic was an official release from the CDC.) Or perhaps they'll fall prey to more subtle graphic design flaws, such as using an excess of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartjunk">chartjunk</a> that their graphing tool includes by default.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, <a href="http://darkhorseanalytics.com/blog/data-looks-better-naked/">data looks better naked</a>. Spend more time stripping your data down than dressing it up. <a href="http://darkhorseanalytics.com/">Darkhorse Analytics</a> made an excellent GIF to explain the point:</p>
<p><a href="http://gfycat.com/ImprobableFemaleBasenji"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/06/data-ink.gif" alt="data-ink" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4883" /></a></p>
<p>(click on the GIF for a gfycat version that allows you to move through it at your own pace)</p>
<p>Antoine de Saint-Exupery put it best:</p>
<blockquote><p>Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.</p></blockquote>
<p>You'll see this in the spirit of all of my plots below.</p>
<h3>Color matters</h3>
<p>The default color scheme in matplotlib is pretty ugly. Die-hard matlab/matplotlib fans may stand by their color scheme to the end, but it's undeniable that Tableau's default color scheme is orders of magnitude better than matplotlib's.</p>
<p>Use established default color schemes from software that is well-known for producing beautiful plots. Tableau has an excellent <a href="http://tableaufriction.blogspot.ro/2012/11/finally-you-can-use-tableau-data-colors.html">set of color schemes</a> to use, ranging from grayscale to colored to color blind-friendly. Which brings me to my next point...</p>
<p>Many graphic designers completely forget about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness">color blindness</a>, which affects over 5% of the viewers of their graphics. For example, a plot using red and green to differentiate two categories of data is going to be <a href="http://99designs.com/designer-blog/2013/04/17/designers-need-to-understand-color-blindness/">completely incomprehensible</a> for anyone with red-green color blindness. Whenever possible, stick to using color blind-friendly color schemes, such as <a href="http://tableaufriction.blogspot.ro/2012/11/finally-you-can-use-tableau-data-colors.html">Tableau's "Color Blind 10."</a></p>
<h3>Required libraries</h3>
<p>You'll need the following Python libraries installed to run this code:</p>
<ul>
<li>matplotlib</li>
<li>pandas</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">Anaconda Python distribution</a> provides an easy double-click installer that includes all of the libraries you'll need.</p>
<h3>Blah, blah, blah... let's get to the code</h3>
<p>Now that we've covered the basics of graphic design, let's dive into the code. I'll explain the "what" and "why" of each line of code with inline comments.</p>

<h3>Easy interactives</h3>
<p>As an added bonus, thanks to <a href="https://plot.ly/python/">plot.ly</a>, it only takes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161228165843/http://nbviewer.jupyter.org:80/github/plotly/python-user-guide/blob/master/s6_matplotlylib/s6_matplotlylib.ipynb">one more line of code</a> to turn your matplotlib plot into an interactive.</p>

<hr />
<h3>More Python plotting libraries</h3>
<p>In this tutorial, I focused on making data visualizations with only Python's basic matplotlib library. If you don't feel like tweaking the plots yourself and want the library to produce better-looking plots on its own, check out the following libraries.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://seaborn.pydata.org/">Seaborn</a> for statistical charts</li>
<li><a href="http://ggplot.yhathq.com/">ggplot2 for Python</a></li>
<li><a href="http://olgabot.github.io/prettyplotlib/">prettyplotlib</a></li>
<li><a href="http://bokeh.pydata.org">Bokeh</a> for interactive charts
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Recommended reading</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/">Edward Tufte</a> has been a pioneer of the "simple, effective plots" approach. Most of the graphic design of my visualizations has been inspired by reading his books.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a> is a classic book filled with plenty of graphical examples that everyone who wants to create beautiful data visualizations should read.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Envisioning-Information-Edward-R-Tufte/dp/0961392118/">Envisioning Information</a> is an excellent follow-up to the first book, again with a plethora of beautiful graphical examples.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other books out there about beautiful graphical design, but the two books above are the ones I found the most educational and inspiring.</p>
