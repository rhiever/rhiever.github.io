<p>Six years ago, the NY Times published one of my favorite interactive graphics entitled, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/02/23/movies/20080223_REVENUE_GRAPHIC.html">"The ebb and flow of movies."</a> This brilliant graphic concisely visualized over two decades of box office sales with the now-popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streamgraph">streamgraph</a>. The colors indicated how well each movie did -- from hit to flop -- and the height of the vertical area signified how "hot" each movie was the box office each week. As you scroll through the years, you'll see now-classics like Back to the Future and Jurassic Park pop up and fade away in the seemingly endless stream of time.</p>
<p>One of the most unfortunate parts of this graphic is that it's terribly outdated at this point: The latest movies listed were popular back when I was still a sophomore in undergrad. As such, this post will be the first in a series of articles documenting my attempts to revitalize and update "The ebb and flow of movies" to 2014 (and soon, 2015).</p>
<h3>Visualizing 3 decades of box office sales</h3>
<p>At this point, I've gathered the weekly box office sales of the top movies for the past 3 decades (1982-2014), which fits comfortably into a ~8 MB file. However, it's been surprisingly difficult to find visualization software that can visualize 3 decades of data into a streamgraph without crashing. I've had the best luck so far has been with the <a href="https://rawgraphs.io/">RAW engine</a>, which I used to plot 5 years of box office sales (2009-2014) below.</p>
<p>Darker blue = more total sales for that movie<br />
Lighter blue = less total sales<br />
Vertical height indicates weekly sales</p>
<p>You can click on all of the images below for zoomed-in versions.</p>

<p>Obviously this graph isn't particularly useful for communicating information about specific movies, but it does show the seasonal ebb and flow of movie sales, which I look at in more detail below. Ultimately, we'll need an interactive version similar to the NY Times rather than this static graph. I'm open to suggestions for software.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I've visualized zoomed-in versions of the past few years of box office sales below. The left side of each label starts on its corresponding area. Sorry for the overlapping names in some cases; there are so many movies that I had to place all of them automatically.</p>

<h3>2014</h3>
<p></center></p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/10/2014-movies-ebb-flow.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/10/2014-movies-ebb-flow-1024x192.png" alt="2014-movies-ebb-flow" width="605" height="113" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5413" /></a></p>

<h3>2013</h3>
<p></center></p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/10/2013-movies-ebb-flow.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/10/2013-movies-ebb-flow-1024x256.png" alt="2013-movies-ebb-flow" width="605" height="151" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5412" /></a></p>
<p><center><br />
<h3>2012</h3>
<p></center></p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/10/2012-movies-ebb-flow.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/10/2012-movies-ebb-flow-1024x256.png" alt="2012-movies-ebb-flow" width="605" height="151" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5411" /></a></p>
<h3>Seasonality of box office sales</h3>
<p>Another phenomenon that the original "Ebb and flow" article pointed to was the seasonality of box office sales:</p>
<blockquote><p>Summer blockbusters and holiday hits make up the bulk of box office revenue each year</p></blockquote>
<p>Streamgraphs make for a pretty presentation of sales, but the seasonal trends are better communicated with a line chart. Below, I calculated the median weekly movie sales for each week over the 1982-2014 period.</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/10/weekly-median-movie-sales.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/10/weekly-median-movie-sales.png" alt="weekly-median-movie-sales" width="752" height="467" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5428" /></a></p>
<p>Sure enough, we see the clear mark of the blockbuster season from mid-June through August and the rush of families to the movie theater after Thanksgiving and Christmas. What's more surprising to me is the spike in mid-April. What's going on there?</p>
<p>That's all for now! Hopefully we can find the software to pull this revival off.</p>
