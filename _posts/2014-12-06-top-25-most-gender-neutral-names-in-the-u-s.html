<p>As a long-time fan of Saturday Night Live, I have fond memories of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_%28Saturday_Night_Live%29">Pat sketch</a> where Pat's friends were always trying to figure out his/her gender through a series of hilarious indirect tests. Despite their every effort -- from asking Pat which bathroom he/she uses to asking about love interests -- Pat's friends could never figure it out.</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/12/pat_snl.gif"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/12/pat_snl.gif" alt="pat_snl" width="256" height="325" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5819" /></a></p>
<p>Put on some techno music and watch that GIF for a little bit. It totally works.</p>
<p>Part of the Pat skit relied on the fact that "Pat" is a fairly gender-neutral name. It could be short for Patricia or Patrick, so it's tough to tell Pat's gender from his/her name alone. As I was working through the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html">U.S. baby names data set</a>, the Pat sketch got me wondering: What are some other gender-neutral names like Pat?</p>
<p>Below, I calculated the most gender-neutral names using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy">entropy</a>, which gives me the highest value (i.e., most gender-neutral) when the name is evenly distributed between boys and girls.</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/12/top-25-us-gender-neutral-names.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/12/top-25-us-gender-neutral-names.png" alt="top-25-us-gender-neutral-names" width="635" height="754" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5818" /></a></p>
<p>Disappointingly, Pat doesn't even come close to the top 25. If we take how America names their babies as any indication of what Pat's gender was, only 11% of all babies named Pat in the last 30 years were female. America's parents have voted: Pat is a boy's name!</p>
<p>There's a few more shockers on this list:</p>
<p>Who names their child Infant or Baby?! The most likely explanation is that these are placeholder names until the parents/guardians can agree on a name.</p>
<p>Apparently Justice <em>is</em> blind when it comes to gender.</p>
<p>I feel bad for the 7,000+ boys named Elisha. At least there aren't many boys named Sue any more: 92% of all babies named Sue were female.</p>
