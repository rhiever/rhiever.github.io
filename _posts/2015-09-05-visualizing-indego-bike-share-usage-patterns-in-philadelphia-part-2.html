<p>A couple months ago, I made <a href="http://www.randalolson.com/2015/07/18/visualizing-indego-bike-share-usage-patterns-in-philadelphia/">an initial foray</a> into understanding the usage patterns of <a href="http://rideindego.com">Indego</a>, Philadelphia's new bike share system. This month, I thought it'd be a fun exercise to revisit that data set to see if I could visualize the usage patterns a little better.</p>
<p>From my <a href="http://www.randalolson.com/2015/07/18/visualizing-indego-bike-share-usage-patterns-in-philadelphia/">previous attempt</a>, we already know that there are clear cyclical usage patterns for many of the Indego stations: Stations in residential areas tend to empty out in the mornings and refill in the evenings, whereas stations in the business sectors do the opposite. In addition to that information, I also wanted to communicate <a href="http://www.randalolson.com/2015/08/15/analyzing-the-health-of-philadelphias-bike-share-system/">the health of the bike stations</a>, i.e., how often the stations are full or empty of bikes.</p>
<p>Below is my attempt at combining both pieces of information into a single graph. <strong>Use this visualization to plan your commutes and avoid the busy hours for your local bike stations.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/indego-bike-station-usage-patterns-july-aug-2015-flip.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2015/09/indego-bike-station-usage-patterns-july-aug-2015-flip.png" alt="indego-bike-station-usage-patterns-july-aug-2015-flip" width="100%" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7642" /></a></p>
<p>Each sub-graph corresponds to an active Indego station, showing the average performance from morning (left) through the evening (right). The y-axis represents the percentage of time the station is full, empty, or somewhere in between during the corresponding hour. Darker reds represent fuller stations, whereas darker blues represent emptier stations.</p>
<p>To give a specific example, let's zoom in on the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/807+S+21st+St,+Philadelphia,+PA+19146/">21st & Catharine station</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/indego-bike-station-usage-21st-catharine-flipped.png.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2015/09/indego-bike-station-usage-21st-catharine-flipped.png.png" alt="indego-bike-station-usage-21st-catharine-flipped.png" width="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7641" /></a></p>
<p>The 21st & Catharine station is clearly a commuter station: The dominant red shades in the mornings and evenings show that it tends to fill up with bikes during non-work hours, while the creeping blue shades during the workday show the station emptying out as people ride bikes to work.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/indego-bike-station-usage-17th-girard-flipped.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2015/09/indego-bike-station-usage-17th-girard-flipped.png" alt="indego-bike-station-usage-17th-girard-flipped" width="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7640" /></a></p>
<p>In contrast, the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/1617+W+Girard+Ave,+Philadelphia,+PA+19130">station at 17th & Girard</a> sees much less action: The station sits more-empty-than-full most of the time, with only a minor outflux of bikes during work hours.</p>
<p><strong>The nice part about these visualizations is that they show how reliably available each bike station is throughout the day</strong>: Stations like 17th & Girard are practically always ready to receive or provide a bike at any point in the day, whereas stations like 21st & Catharine are regularly bouncing between full and empty on the weekdays.</p>
<hr />
<p>So, what do you think? Does this visualization method show the station usage trends better than before? How do you think it can be improved from here?</p>
