<p>One of the most common questions that newcomers to data [science/visualization/analysis] ask is: "What tools should I use to create data visualizations?" While I always <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920046592.do">recommend</a> learning design principles <em>before</em> tools, I thought I'd take a stab at answering that question by analyzing what tools the <a href="http://reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful">/r/DataIsBeautiful</a> community uses.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, /r/DataIsBeautiful is an online community dedicated to data analysis and visualization, where people post and discuss various data visualizations from around the web. Sometimes /r/DataIsBeautiful community members create and share their own data visualizations -- called "OC," or Original Content -- which I have always found to be a great source of ideas and inspiration.</p>
<p>As part of the /r/DataIsBeautiful posting rules, every OC contributor must include a comment on their post describing the data source(s) and tool(s) they used to create their data visualization. Thus, analyzing their tool usage over the years was a fairly simple n-gram analysis of all comments made by OC contributors on /r/DataIsBeautiful that mention the word "tool." For this article, I analyzed <a href="#comment-data">thousands of comments</a> made by OC contributors to /r/DataIsBeautiful between January 2014 and January 2016.</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2016/03/DIB-tools-used-bar.png" rel="attachment wp-att-7876"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2016/03/DIB-tools-used-bar.png" alt="DIB-tools-used-bar" width="787" height="449" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7876" /></a></p>
<p>(Unfortunately, it was difficult to parse out mentions of the "R" language with the n-gram analysis, so we'll have to use ggplot2 as a proxy.)</p>
<p>The most popular tools on /r/DataIsBeautiful are:</p>

</table>
<p>As expected, Excel dominates the list as the primary tool that most beginners use: In this case, there have been at least 643 OC data visualizations on /r/DataIsBeautiful that were made with Excel. Excel is a great tool to start with, but you should eventually move on to more advanced tools that allow you to programmatically generate visualizations such as matplotlib/Seaborn, D3.js, or ggplot2. If programming isn't your forte, Tableau is a much better option than Excel.</p>

<p>I was also curious about temporal trends in library usage, so I grouped the tool mentions by year and plotted them below.</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2016/03/DIB-tools-used-line.png" rel="attachment wp-att-7877"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2016/03/DIB-tools-used-line.png" alt="DIB-tools-used-line" width="605" height="343" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7877" /></a></p>
<p>GUI-based visualization tools such as Tableau and Gephi are seeing steady growth, whereas Python and matplotlib (oddly) seem to be waning in relative popularity. D3.js and ggplot2 are similarly experiencing steady growth, although I should note that 2016's counts are only based on January 2016's comments and may change by the end of the year. We'll have to revisit these trends come 2017.</p>
<p>Hopefully that answers all of your data visualization tool-related questions! If you have any more questions or concerns, please leave them in the comments.</p>
