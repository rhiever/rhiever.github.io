<p>I put together a couple demo videos for our Active Categorical Classifier (ACC) project that we'll be presenting at the <a href="http://ppsn2016.org">PPSN 2016</a> conference.</p>
<p>If you're interested in this project and can't wait for PPSN, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08233">preprint of the paper</a> on arXiv,</li>
<li>the <a href="https://github.com/rhiever/edd">C++ code</a> on GitHub, and</li>
<li>a <a href="https://github.com/rhiever/active-categorical-classifier">demo of the new Python version</a> on GitHub.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the first video, I show the entire image as the ACC roams around it trying to classify the object. Even though we can see the entire image at once, the ACC only sees the 9 pixels in its immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>In the second video below, I only show the pixels that the ACC has seen during the simulation. Can you guess what digit it is before the ACC?</p>

<p>I think the second video does a great job of showing how little information the ACC is processing to classify each image. Talk about a light-weight classifier!</p>
