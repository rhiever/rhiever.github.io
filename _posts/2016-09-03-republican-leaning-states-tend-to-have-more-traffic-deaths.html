<p>Back in 2014, the U.S. Department of Transportation <a href="http://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/t/general-statistics/fatalityfacts/state-by-state-overview">released a report</a> on the (normalized) number of traffic deaths in each U.S. state. As I looked through the list, I noticed an odd correlation between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states">political leanings of a state</a> and its traffic fatalities.</p>
<p>To confirm this notion, I used box plots to show the distribution of traffic deaths based on how Republican-leaning each state is, where each dot represents a state.</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2016/09/republican-victories-vs-traffic-deaths.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2016/09/republican-victories-vs-traffic-deaths.png" alt="republican-victories-vs-traffic-deaths" width="605" height="520" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8425" /></a></p>
<p>In case you're wondering, Delaware is the Democratic outlier with 1.26 deaths per 100 million miles traveled. Outliers aside, we see an abundantly clear trend: <strong>Republican-leaning states tend to have more traffic deaths</strong>.</p>
<p>To provide another view, I plotted the same data set as a scatter plot and fit a linear regression below. Each dot represents a state. Again, we see a strong relationship between Republican-leaning states and more traffic deaths.</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2016/09/republican-victories-vs-traffic-deaths-scatter.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2016/09/republican-victories-vs-traffic-deaths-scatter.png" alt="republican-victories-vs-traffic-deaths-scatter" width="666" height="699" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8424" /></a></p>
<p>At this point, I feel obligated to make the caveat that these charts only establish a correlation, and it doesn't mean that residents of Republican-leaning states experience higher traffic deaths because they tend to vote Republican. However, it sure makes for an interesting statistic to ponder: why would there be a correlation between traffic death rate and tendency to vote Republican?</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/dafairlie">David Fairlie</a> for sharing these interesting statistics on /r/DataIsBeautiful.</p>
