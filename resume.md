Graduated with dual major in Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, and Behavior

Doctoral Advisor: [Prof. Christoph Adami](https://mmg.natsci.msu.edu/people/faculty/adami-christoph-c/)

### B.S. in Computer Science

**[University of Central Florida](https://www.cs.ucf.edu/)** - Orlando, FL - 2005 to 2010

Graduated with Honors In Major

Undergraduate Advisor: [Prof. Kenneth Stanley](https://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/)

# Professional Experience

### Technical Consultant

**[Randal S. Olson]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/)** - Vancouver, WA - 2013 to Present

In 2022, I transitioned to full-time consulting, primarily assisting startups with strategic guidance and practical solutions for harnessing data science and AI. I excel at transforming visionary concepts into functional prototypes.

One of my favorite projects was to help build an AI system that automatically develops [epic road trips around Europe](https://guidetoeurope.com/).

### Senior AI Scientist

**[Absci](https://www.absci.com/)** - Vancouver, WA - 2021 to 2022

I helped build ETL systems at the intersection of the wet labs and the AI team so we could develop LLMs for drug discovery.

### Data Science and Machine Learning Advisor

**[FOXO Technologies](https://foxotechnologies.com/)** - Minneapolis, MN - 2021 to 2022

I sat on the FOXO Scientific Advisory Board and advised on the data science and machine learning technology developments at FOXO.

### Chief Data Scientist

**[FOXO Technologies](https://foxotechnologies.com/)** - Minneapolis, MN - 2020 to 2021

I was promoted to Chief Data Scientist so I could better serve the company mission of bringing epigenetic testing to the life insurance industry.

While holding this role, I built a data science and software engineering team from the ground up. The purpose of this team was to merge cutting edge epigenetics research with advanced machine learning technology to improve mortality assessment for the life insurance industry and beyond. Since 2018, my team and I have:

* conducted observational research studies with human subjects,
* performed data collection and cleaning on datasets containing over 800,000 molecular measurements and hundreds of human and wellness indicators,
* developed custom DNA methylation processing software from scratch (e.g., [https://github.com/FoxoTech/methylprep](https://github.com/FoxoTech/methylprep)),
* built a cloud-based serverless automated DNA methylation processing platform,
* curated our data into a proprietary research database on the cloud,
* prototyped MVP machine learning models based on our proprietary research database using a state-of-the-art AutoML platform,
* deployed said MVP models into production with a state-of-the-art MLOps platform, and
* integrated said deployed models into a customer-facing web platform.

Issued Patents:
*  **Olson, Randal S.** and Chen, Brian H. [Machine learned epigenetic status indicator](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11795495B1/en). **Issued** U.S. Patent 11795495.
* Sabes, Jon; Chen, Brian H.; and **Olson, Randal S.** [Machine learning model trained to determine a biochemical state and/or medical condition using DNA epigenetic data]([https://patentsgazette.uspto.gov/week46/OG/html/1516-2/US11817214-20231114.html](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11817214B1/en)). **Issued** U.S. Patent 11817214.

### Lead Data Scientist

**[FOXO Technologies](https://foxotechnologies.com/)** - Minneapolis, MN - 2018 to 2020

I was hired as the Lead Data Scientist to execute the company mission of bringing epigenetic testing to life insurance. While holding this role, I built a data science and software engineering team from the ground up. The purpose of this team was to merge cutting edge epigenetics research with advanced machine learning technology to improve mortality assessment for the life insurance industry and beyond.

### Senior Data Scientist

**[University of Pennsylvania](https://ibi.med.upenn.edu/)** - Philadelphia, PA - 2016 to 2018

After working as a postdoctoral researcher for a year, I transitioned into a staff researcher position in Prof. Jason H. Moore's lab at Penn's Institute for Biomedical Informatics. At Penn, I continued developing state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms with a focus on biomedical applications. I also continued aiding Prof. Moore in developing a biomedical visualization laboratory, which will offer machine learning and data analysis as a service to PennMed faculty and physicians. While holding this role, I also assisted the lab in integrating the lab's research projects into the Python data science ecosystem. This entailed translating research code into performant and well-engineered software. Some of those projects include:
* [https://github.com/EpistasisLab/scikit-rebate](https://github.com/EpistasisLab/scikit-rebate)
* [https://github.com/EpistasisLab/scikit-mdr](https://github.com/EpistasisLab/scikit-mdr)
* [https://github.com/EpistasisLab/pmlb](https://github.com/EpistasisLab/pmlb)

### Postdoctoral Researcher

**[University of Pennsylvania](https://ibi.med.upenn.edu/)** - Philadelphia, PA - 2015 to 2016

I joined Prof. Jason H. Moore's research lab at Penn's Institute for Biomedical Informatics. At Penn, I developed state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms with a focus on biomedical applications. I also aided Prof. Moore in laying the groundwork for a biomedical visualization laboratory that will be used as a collaborative research space by the Penn medical school. While holding this role, I pioneered the field of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and built TPOT, one of the most-used open source AutoML libraries in the world. TPOT has since grown into a mature open source library on its own: [https://github.com/EpistasisLab/tpot](https://github.com/EpistasisLab/tpot)

### Graduate Research Assistant

**[Michigan State University](https://mmg.natsci.msu.edu/people/faculty/adami-christoph-c/)** - East Lansing, MI - 2011 to 2015

I spent 4 years working on a dual major Ph.D. at Michigan State University working with Prof. Christoph Adami. During my time there, I developed a high-performance C++ platform for digitally studying the evolution of intelligent animal behavior over long, evolutionary timescales. Using this platform, I published several articles in peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings to share what I learned about the evolution of cooperation and intelligence.

### Software Engineer

**[Warner Robins AFB](https://www.robins.af.mil/)** - Warner Robins, GA - 2010 to 2011

I worked as a civilian employee for the Air Force developing tools for the Electronic Warfare division. My time here was primarily spent as a software engineer working on classified software in a larger software development team.
