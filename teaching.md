<p><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920046592.do" rel="attachment wp-att-7898"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2016/03/dataviz-basics-python-video-course.jpg" alt="dataviz-basics-python-video-course" width="500" height="281" class="size-full wp-image-7898" /></a></p>
<p>In this Data Visualization Basics with Python training course, I will teach you how to create effective data visualizations in Python. This course is designed for users that already have some experience with programming in Python.</p>
<p>You will start by learning about the basics of data visualization, including types of charts, common pitfalls and good practices in data visualization, and data sources. Finally, I will teach you about matplotlib, including how to use matplotlib in the Jupyter Notebook, matplotlib styles, and subplots and small multiples.</p>
<p>Once you have completed this computer based training course, you will have learned a number of tips, tricks, and best practices for creating effecting data visualizations in Python. Working files are included, allowing you to follow along with the author throughout the lessons.</p>
